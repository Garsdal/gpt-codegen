    Later in this prompt I will provide you with the head() of a dataframe as csv inside [].

    You must write code to convert a dataframe to standard format. Standard format must fulfill the conditions:
    1. The index must datetimeindex with format “%Y-%mm-%dd %HH:%MM”
    2. The index name must be "TimeUTC"
    3. There must only be one column and the index
    3. The only column must contain Power signal as a float value with unit kW
    4. The column name must be “Power“

    The Python code should fullfill the following conditions:
    1. The code must not contain any comments. Never.
    2. The code should set the index before any other operation.
    3. The code must be dynamic and work for a dataframe of any size but with the structure inside []
    4. The code must load the dataframe at the beginning from “{input_filepath}” without any formatting
    5. The code must save the dataframe to “{output_filepath}”
    6. The code must save the dataframe with sep=";" and index=True. Always.
